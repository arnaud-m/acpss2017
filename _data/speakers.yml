  title: "Professor"
  bio: "After completing his PhD in computer science and operations research at Université de Montréal, Louis-Martin Rousseau joined the Mathematics and Industrial Engineering Department at École Polytechnique de Montréal in 2003. Louis-Martin was one of the first researchers to investigate the hybridization of classical operations research methods and constraint programming, which comes from artificial intelligence. His current research focuses on transportation logistics, scheduling and resource optimization in healthcare."

He obtained his Ph.D. and HDR in computer science from University Nice Sophia Antipolis in 2001 and 2010 respectively. </br> His research interests include algorithmic graph theory, combinatorial optimization and operations research with communication networks as main application area (routing, fault tolerance, reliable design, etc.). He is particularly interested in decomposition and pre-processing methods that can be used to better understand the structure of graphs and he uses this information in the design of algorithms. He collaborates with industrial partners such as Alcatel-Bell labs, Orange labs, 3Roam, Amadeus, Benomad, Instant-System. He contributes the development of graph optimization libraries such as <a href=\"http://grph.inria.fr\">Grph</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sagemath.org\">SageMath</a>. In 2016, he won together with Nathann Cohen the Flinders Hamiltonian Cycle Problem Challenge, an international competition on the famous Hamiltonian Cycle problem."
