If there is any problem, please tell the local organizers immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain ACP summer school's awesomeness. 

__The ACP has installed the following policy for duty of respect and equal opportunity to be observed during its activities.__


###### Duty of Respect ######

The ACP is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone at its events (conferences, summer schools, etc.), regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. The ACP enforces a duty of respect policy, even before or after the event. In case of problems, the event organisers may take any actions they deem appropriate.

###### Equal Opportunity ######

The ACP is dedicated to providing an equal opportunity of attending its events (conferences, summer schools, etc.) and favours venues with wheelchair accessibility. If you have an accepted paper at an ACP event or your application for participation has been accepted, but you are in a difficult or disadvantaged position that jeopardises your participation, then contact the local organisers of the event. Examples are the provision of childcare during the event, crosschecks on the wheelchair accessibility of the event venues and hotels, as well as financial assistance for the registration and accommodation, and possibly travel, of a PhD student in a difficult financial situation.


<!-- __This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__ -->


<!-- The ACP prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. -->
<!-- That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at ACP meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting. -->

<!-- If someone is bothering you, please tell the local organizers immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain ACP summer school's awesomeness. -->
