Hello,

The presentations are now available online in the SPEAKERS or SCHEDULE tabs by clicking on the speaker/session vignette.

Here is a few statistics about the school.
We were 65 participants from 14 different countries spread into four categories.

| France&nbsp; | E.U.&nbsp; | Outside E.U. |
|--------------+------------+--------------|
|           44 |         16 |            5 |


| Organizers&nbsp; | Speakers&nbsp; | Students&nbsp; | Academic |
|------------------+----------------+----------------+----------|
|                4 |              8 |             47 |        6 |


And, there was 7 girls.


Here is a picture showing how serious we were during the DIY sessions ;)
